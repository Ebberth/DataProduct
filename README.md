## Documentation

### This Shiny Application
This shiny application has been created as a course project for the 'Developing Data Products' under Coursera. Below you can find supporting documentation for users to get started with the application. This application was Deployed on Rstudio's shiny server and the application link was shared on Coursera.

* The application has been deployed on Rstudio's shiny server
* The application link can be copied [here](http://help.shinyapps.io/DataProduct/) (if needed)
* The server.R and ui.R code can be found on [Github](http://github.com/ebberth/DataProduct)
* The application also include the following:
    1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
    2. Some operation on the ui input in server.R
    3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
    4. Documentation that a novice user could reference
    5. Documentation posted at the Shiny website itself

### What This Application Do?
This application converts between three temperature scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

#### Fahrenheit Scale
Fahrenheit (symbol °F) is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686-1736), after whom the scale is named.[1] There exist several accounts of how he originally defined his scale. The lower defining point, 0 degrees, was established as the temperature of a solution of brine made from equal parts of ice and salt. Further limits were established as the melting point of water (32 degrees) and his best estimate of the average human body temperature (96 degrees, about 2-1/2 degrees less than modern measurements).[2] The scale is now usually defined by two fixed points: the temperature at which water freezes into ice is defined as 32 degrees, and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212 degrees, a 180-degree separation, as defined at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure. (Wikipedia)

#### kelvin Scale
The kelvin is a unit of measure for temperature based upon an absolute scale. It is one of the seven base units in the International System of Units (SI) and is assigned the unit symbol K. The Kelvin scale is an absolute, thermodynamic temperature scale using as its null point absolute zero, the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics. The kelvin is defined as the fraction 1???273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water (exactly 0.01 °C or 32.018 °F).[1] In other words, it is defined such that the triple point of water is exactly 273.16 K. (Wikipedia)

#### Celsius Scale
Celsius, historically known as centigrade,[1][2] is a scale and unit of measurement for temperature. As an SI derived unit, it is used by most countries in the world. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701-1744), who developed a similar temperature scale. The degree Celsius (°C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. Before being renamed to honour Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called centigrade, from the Latin centum, which means 100, and gradus, which means steps. (Wikipedia)

### How to Use
